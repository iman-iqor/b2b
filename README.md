Born2beRoot

📌 Project Overview

Born2beRoot is a system administration project where you configure a secure virtual server from scratch. The goal is to understand key Linux concepts, user management, security measures, and compliance with strict system administration rules.

🖥️ Technologies Used

Operating System: Debian or CentOS (as per project requirements)

Virtualization: VirtualBox or UTM

Services & Tools: SSH, UFW, Sudo, AppArmor/SELinux, Cron

Bonus: Lighttpd, WordPress, MariaDB, Fail2Ban

📋 Project Requirements

Install and configure a Debian-based or CentOS-based virtual machine.

Implement user management: create a strong password policy, set up a sudo group, and restrict root login.

Configure SSH for remote access and security.

Set up a firewall (UFW or FirewallD) to allow only necessary services.

Implement password expiration policies and security settings.

Monitor system logs and resource usage using cron jobs.

Ensure compliance with system rules and provide documentation.

🔧 Key Configurations

1️⃣ User Management & Security

Enforce password complexity and expiration (/etc/login.defs).

Create a sudo group and assign privileges (/etc/sudoers).

Disable root login and set SSH key authentication (/etc/ssh/sshd_config).

2️⃣ Firewall & Networking

Configure UFW (Debian) or FirewallD (CentOS) to allow only SSH, HTTP, and other required services.

Ensure ports are secured and unused ones are closed.

3️⃣ Monitoring & Logging

Implement cron jobs for automated system monitoring.

Use lslogins and journalctl for log analysis.

Set up log rotation to manage storage efficiently.

4️⃣ Bonus Implementation

Install and configure Lighttpd, MariaDB, and WordPress.

Set up Fail2Ban to prevent brute-force attacks.

Implement disk partitioning and optimize storage management.

🏁 How to Run the Project

Download and install VirtualBox or UTM.

Install the required Debian or CentOS OS.

Follow the setup steps to configure the system.

Test security configurations and monitoring tools.

📜 Final Notes

The project teaches essential Linux system administration skills.

Ensures a deep understanding of security best practices.

Focuses on automation, user management, and secure server setup.

🔹 This project is a great foundation for anyone looking to improve their Linux server management skills! 🚀
